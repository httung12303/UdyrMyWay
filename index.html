                    <div><p>Tired of the 200-year club with long ass abilities descriptions? League has (way too) many dashes nowadays? Feeling like a little bit of old school mechanics? I'm here to bring you just what you want - The Dyr.</p>
                        <p>If you ever watched Synapse or any other LOL content before, you must know the man, the myth, the legend, the breacher, the griefer, the El Truco - the one and only Trick2g. Learn how to play the Dyr, experience the struggles, talk shit, eat shit and sometime pop off like that bald headed losing hairline motherfucker. How? Just go through this page and you'll be come the next generation of the GOD DYR.</p>
                        <p><em>(I won't be covering jungle Dyr since he's pretty much braindead power farming in most games.)</em></p>

                    <div class="info">
                        <div class="name">Trinity Force</div>
                        <div>Just the best item you can have on the Dyr. Triforce has everything you need: health, damage, attack speed, CDR, movement speed and <em>BIG</em> tower damage. This item is good on literally every Udyr build, tank, bruiser, phoenix max and the best for breaching. However, the components are not that strong early on so going for something like extra Doran ring, blade, shield, Glacial Buckler or Hexdrinker on your first back is recommended.</div> 
                    </div>

                    <div class="info">
                        <div class="name">Frozen Heart</div>
                        <div>The best armor option for the Spririt Walker. Mana, CDR and <em>alot</em> of armor, this item covers many weak spots of Udyr: high mana cost early and mid game, clunky skill changes with low CDR and low base health and armor, allowing you to face tank most AD champ as soon as you hit this item. Frozen Heart is so good, soemtimes its better to rush it before Triforce.</div>

                        <div class="name">Boots Of Swiftness</div>
                        <div>The fastest boots for the (once upon a time) fastest champ in League. Slow reduction is your best friend when playing the Dyr. Plus, the high movement speed that it gives allows you to catch up with the 200-year club champs, which are mostly much faster than the Dyr. When it comes to boots, just remember that Swifties is always the best.</div>

                        <div>The MR counter of Frozen Heart. Speed, the highest MR of all items and AP damage reduction, you name it. FON will give you juice you need to run through any comp with any AP and CC. Spririt Visage? Get the fuck outa here. FON is the real deal.</div>

                        <div>The second best split push item right after Trinity. Hull gives you very good stats(hp, MR,armor) and <em>huge</em> tower damage. However, lacking CDR is a major drawback, leaving Hull at the bottom of this list.</div>

                        <div>There is no hope in ranking for an Udyr top main. But you do have the opportunities to talk shit when you win with a piece of shit. Don't belive me? Watch this amazing Philipino player with over 10 years of experience on the Rift. Introducing the man, the myth, the legend, the griefer, the father, the El Truco, the one and only:<strong><em>Trick2g</em></strong>. Join him in his wonderful adventures as he spread the domination(sometimes) on the Rift, and keyboards on the floor while hard-stuck in Plat after reaching Master (NA of course). Feel the joy, the pain and laugh your fuckin ass off with his daily uploads. Who knows? You might even quit League as a bonus.</div>
